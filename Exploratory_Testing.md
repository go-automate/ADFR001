# Exploratory Testing

## Aim

Exploratory Testing will capture any application failures due to unusual user behaviour.

## Guidance

A simple procedure for exploratory testing must be captured here. It must describe the methodologies used (e.g. boundary testing), links to guidance documents for the application and the tools needed (e.g. chrome plugins for recording your test session in a video).

## Defect Management

The defect management process must be included here also. It must describe how defects are captured, reviewed, assigned and included in a sprint.
